  As of current standing, residents in the Bronx suffer from rent or household burden. About 56% of residents are classified undering using 30%-50% of their income on rent. As a result, those who use most of their income on rent suffer from  issues such as poor health, unclean living conditions and lack of access to services. This then leaves them with not enough money to afford food, transportation, child care or clothing or even entertainment on their free time.
<p>
  The more money a household spents on rent the more it is likely for them to suffer from harsh qualities of life. Even though the Bronx is considered the lowest in rent across all five boroughs, residents in the Concourse, Highbridge, Mott Haven and Mott Eden suffer from high cost of living. If you take a look at figure 1 below, the Morisania, Mott Haven and Highbridge section of the Bronx are in the lowest percentile of overall median household income.
</p>
  <p>
    In recent years, residents in these low income areas are finding it hard to find low income housing leaving them at risk for displacement. Residents are unable to afford rent because of stagnant prices and widespread housing shortages across New York City.
